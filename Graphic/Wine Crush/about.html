  <h1>How to play</h1>
  <p>Score points by swiping the wine-related items in the game up, down, left,
  or right into combinations of three or more of the same kind.</p>
  
  <p>Your combinations can be horizontal:<p>
  
  <p><img src="horizontal_match_example.gif" class="center" /></p>
  
  <p>Or they can be vertical:</p>
  
  <p><img src="vertical_match_example.gif" class="center" /></p>
  
  <p>At the start of each level, you'll have be given a number of moves and
  a target score. If you reach the target score within your given number of moves,
  you'll get to proceed to the next level!</p>
  
  <p><img src="moves_left_target_explained.png" class="center" /></p>
  
  <p>The game ends when you don't achieve the target score within your
  allotted number of moves.</p>
  
  <p>Sometimes, you might have trouble finding a combination. That's what this
  button's for:</p>
  
  <p><img src="hint_button.png" class="center" /></p>
  
  <p>Press the <strong>Hint</strong> button and the game will show you a combination
  that you can make. There's a price for the hint: it costs 10 points.</p>
  
  <p>There may be times where there aren't any combinations on the screen. That's
  when this button comes in handy:</p>
  
  <p><img src="shuffle_button.png" class="center" /></p>
  
  <p>Press the <strong>Shuffle</strong> button shuffle the items in the game into
  new positions. There's a price for shuffling: it costs one move, and you have
  only one move left, it's game over for you.</p>
  
  <p>And finally, when it's time to return to the real world or drink some wine,
  you'll want to make use of this button:</p>
  
  <p><img src="quit_button.png" class="center" /></p>
  
  <p>Press the <strong>Quit</strong> button to end the game.</p>
